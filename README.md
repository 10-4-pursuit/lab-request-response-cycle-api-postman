# Request Response Cycle, APIs, and Postman Lab

You will be working with a free API of your choice for this lab.

## Getting Started

1. Choose an API with no auth and no CORS from the following list. It _should not_ be one that you've already seen or worked on in class.
   - [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
1. Choose an API not covered in your readings, class, or other assignments. The API should be new to you.
1. Write your answers in this README.md file. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers after the `>`. If you need to write more than one paragraph, add more `>`.
1. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

## Instructions

Do your best to answer the questions with specific details. Writing about code clearly and thoroughly is a critical skill to practice.

- Which one did you choose? Provide the name and base URL.

> http://www.purgomalum.com

- What is the purpose of this API? Describe what data the API provides and why someone might want to use it.

> The purpose of this API is to filter and remove content of profanity, obscenity and other unwanted text.

- What is the URL of the documentation?

> http://www.purgomalum.com

### Response

For the following questions, choose a single endpoint to request within Postman.

- What is the full URL of the endpoint?

> http://www.purgomalum.com/profanitylist.html

- What response do you receive when you make a request to that endpoint? Be sure to wrap your answer in the correct formatting for JSON.

```

- What status code did you get back from your request? Why did you receive this status code?

> 200 OK. I received this status code because the request successfully reached the server, was formatted as expected, and that the server could respond.

- Click on the **response** headers in Postman. What are the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` (provide exact values)?

> `Content-Type`: text/html

> `Content-Length`: 1493

- Summarize the most salient parts of the data you are getting back. How would you describe what is included within the response?

> The data we received includes was a list of profane words.

- Identify at least two ways to use the data within a web application.

> I could imagine integrating this API into an app that highlight the words in the list and suggest decent substitutions. Another use case would be not allow these words to be implimented or allowed in an application aim to be used by adolescences.  

### Documentation

The following questions relate to the documentation of the API.

- What did you like about the documentation? Cite specific examples.

> The documentation was helpful because it gives a current list of available parameters which can be used in the request query string and it provides examples of PurgoMalum implementations.

- What did you find challenging about the documentation? Cite specific examples.

> I found the documentation challenging because it didn't explain what the API function could do in layman-readable format.

- Did the quality of the documentation impact your decision to use it?

> Yes because it provided me with enough information on how to obtain the data.

- Did you switch which API you chose initially because of its documentation, or did you stick with the one you selected and work your way through it?

> No I ended up sticking with the one I selected and worked my way through it.

### Definitions

The following questions require you to define some concepts and terms. Provide detailed explanations.

- In your own words, summarize the request-response cycle.

> The request-response cycle is a fundamental concept in web communication that outlines the interaction between a client and a server.

- In your own words, describe what an API is.

> An API is  a bridge that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

- In your own words, describe the purpose of Postman.

> Postman is an application that is designed to streamline and facilitate the process of working with APIs during the development and testing phases.
